## We require a second round of annotations that are capable of taking into account the rotational orientation of each whale. 

##In order to do this, within this directory, follow the instructions outlined in the original ImageAnnotations directory, only instead of a rectangle, you will draw two points, one just outside the tip of the whale's head, and the other just past the blowholes.

##Use the following images for reference:

![alt tag](/ImageAnnotation2/marked_w_160.jpg)

![alt tag](/ImageAnnotation2/marked_w_316.jpg)

![alt tag](/ImageAnnotation2/marked_w_576.jpg)

##Finally, there is a third annotation called illegible. An image is illegible if the pattern of callosities on the whale's head are too hard to distinguish. Use this annotation anywhere on the image if that image is illegible, otherwise, do not use this annotation. The lines are blurry as to the legibility of an image, but try to make a judgement call as to weather the pattern is clear enough to be distinguished.
